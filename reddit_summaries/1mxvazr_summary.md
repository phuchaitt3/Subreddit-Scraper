* **`S12`**: Actually it is still relevant and getting constant support and updates.
* **`S16`**: I'd say it is still relevant although there are better ways to do this nowadays, with things like codechunkers, AST based storage methods TrustGraph: We started out building TrustGraph as GraphRAG tech.

## Part 2: Final Summary (with Citations)

Many RAG projects on platforms like GitHub tend to become irrelevant or incomplete over time, making them less useful after a year [S4]. However, some projects, such as TrustGraph, remain relevant and continue to receive support and updates, indicating their ongoing utility [S12]. Despite newer methods like codechunkers and AST-based storage emerging, certain projects still hold value, especially if built on solid foundations like GraphRAG technology [S16]. For example, the RAG framework I developed a year ago continues to function effectively today, with the core data ingestion pipeline remaining largely unchanged—about 80% the same—highlighting that some RAG projects can maintain relevance over time [S22, S24].
