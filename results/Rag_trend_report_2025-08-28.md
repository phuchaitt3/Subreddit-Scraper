## Best Practices and Challenges in Building RAG Systems

**Summary:** The community frequently discusses the core stages of RAG—ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval—highlighting the importance of combining proven techniques rather than relying on silver bullets. Chunking strategies, especially for complex or structured documents like legal texts, and evaluation methods are common pain points.

## Vector Databases and Alternatives for Retrieval

**Summary:** Users share extensive real-world experiences with vector databases such as Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, and pgvector, debating their scalability, performance, and limitations. Alternative approaches like reasoning-based retrieval without vectors (e.g., PageIndex) generate discussion around balancing complexity, relevance, and explainability.

## Document Parsing and Multimodal Data Extraction

**Summary:** Parsing diverse document types (PDFs, Office files, images) for RAG ingestion is a frequent topic, with community members recommending open-source tools for text extraction, OCR, and structured data parsing. Challenges include handling embedded images, tables, and diagrams, and integrating these into RAG pipelines effectively.

## Managing LLM Limitations and Hallucinations in RAG Applications

**Summary:** There is a strong emphasis on understanding that LLMs do not "know" facts but generate statistically likely outputs, leading to hallucinations and inconsistencies. Community members advocate designing robust systems with structured outputs, human oversight, and prompt engineering to mitigate these issues and build trustworthy AI applications.
