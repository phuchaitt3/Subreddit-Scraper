In the context of a Reddit post, the "Score" represents the **net number of upvotes** that a submission (post) has received.

It's calculated as:

**Score = (Number of Upvotes) - (Number of Downvotes)**

So, if a post has a score of 5, it means that there are 5 more upvotes than downvotes on that particular post. A higher score generally indicates a more popular or well-received post within the subreddit.
